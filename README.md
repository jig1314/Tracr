# Product Vision
This team project aims to simplify property management for individual real estate investors. The end product will allow property owners to track their properties and their information. The owners will be able to input information related to their renters and how much rent they are receiving on a recurring basis. Then, based on the mortage and rent information entered by the property owner, the application will be able to calculate net profit on properties in their portfolio. The application will use APIs such as Zillow to search for rent estimates near the owners' properties and make rent adjustment suggestions to maximize profit. This will allow property investors to have a central dashboard to oversee all their investments and ensure they’re operating at a profit. The application will provide notifications to the property owner related to their properties and assets. The product will use APIs such as Zillow and the data related to the investor’s current profile to determine if they can purchase another property and display what its predicted profit output could be.
