# Sprint 3 Documentation

## Sprint 3 Forecast & Rationale
For sprint 3, our estimated velocity is 9 story points. Our rationale is that for the 3 week sprint, each developer can dedicate at least 6 hours of work to this project.  
We have 5 developers, working an average of 6 hours over 3 weeks equates to 90 hours of work. We represent those 90 hours as 9 story points.  
Our velocity was decresed to account for the time that the developers would need to spend on preparing the research paper for this class.
We are going to reassess at the end of the sprint if this velocity needs to be decreased, increased or kept the same based on actuals.
