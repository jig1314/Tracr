# Sprint 1 Documentation

## Sprint 1 Forecast & Rationale
For sprint 1, our estimated velocity is 12 story points. Our rationale is that for the 3 week sprint each developer can dedicate at least 8 hours of work to this project.  
We have 5 developers, working an average of 8 hours over 3 weeks equates to 120 hours of work. We represent those 120 hours as 12 story points.  
We are going to reassess at the end of the sprint if this velocity needs to be decreased, increased or kept the same based on actuals.
